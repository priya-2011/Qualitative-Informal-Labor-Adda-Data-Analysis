Qualitative Data Analysis - Informal Labor Markets Overview This repository documents a research project conducted between May 2023 and July 2023, focusing on Qualitative Data Analysis in the context of Informal Labor Markets. The project was carried out under the mentorship of Dr. Venkat G Ram Reddy and aimed to shed light on critical aspects of informal labor, such as wages, job security, and social protection. Our findings have the potential to influence policy discussions and contribute to inclusive growth.

Project Goals The primary objectives of this research were as follows:

Survey Informal Workers: We conducted surveys across five different states to gather insights directly from informal workers. This step allowed us to access real-world perspectives on their employment conditions.

Data Analysis: The collected data underwent rigorous statistical analysis and qualitative assessment. Our aim was to identify trends, patterns, and disparities in wages, job security, and social protection among informal laborers.

Contribute to Academic Research: By rigorously analyzing the data and drawing meaningful conclusions, we aimed to contribute significantly to academic research in the field of informal labor markets.

Inform Policy Discussions: Our findings are valuable inputs for policy discussions and decisions. We believe that informed policies can help promote inclusive growth and improve the lives of informal laborers.
